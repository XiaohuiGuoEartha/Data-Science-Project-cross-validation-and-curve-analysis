# Data-Science-Project-cross-validation-and-curve-analysis
In this project we will be looking at data generated by particle physicists to test whether machine learning can help classify wether certain particle decay experiements identify the presence of a Higgs Boson. The project includes three parts: data preparation, basic evaluation, and model selection with cross validation.
